# _neomoonfly_

![_neomoonfly_](./screenshots/pallete.png)

_neomoonfly_ is a fork of the [_moonfly_](https://github.com/bluz71/vim-moonfly-colors)
theme created by bluz71. I take absolutely no credit for the vast majority of
the theme: there are a couple of minor modifications made to accommodate for
some of my personal preferences, but other than that, it's pretty much exactly
the same.

Sources of inspiration for the original _moonfly_ theme include:

- [Monokai](https://monokai.pro)
- [One Dark](https://github.com/atom/atom/tree/master/packages/one-dark-syntax)

Although not even tangentially related to _neomoonfly_ or _moonfly_, bluz71,
the creator of _moonfly_, maintains another theme named _nightfly_, which is
available [here](https://github.com/bluz71/vim-nightfly-guicolors).
